README for fsimage                                                 20050222
 
fsimage is a scriptable filesystem tool. The beauty of fsimage is that it is
a small linux distribution that runs inside the qemu emulator, providing access
to filesystems that is both independent of host kernel or operating system and
root permissions.

The code for fsimage is available in two versions. The version suitable for 
most users [1] contains a precompiled x86-image and a shell script. The more 
advanced version [2] is a collection of all sources required to build the 
x86-image, including a x86 cross compiler - complete with scripts to automate
the build procedure.

fsimage requires qemu to run, at least 0.6.1. fsimage needs the integrated 
tftp server in qemu so versions prior 0.6.1 will not work. fsimage expects to 
find qemu in /usr/bin/qemu.

Sources for qemu are not included. Only qemu-0.6.1 is tested.

Please note that the bzImage generated from the sources should be around
3 MiB large. If the size of the bzImage is very different (11-21 MiB) then
it is very likely that you have a buggy cpio-2.6 installed on your host.

Version 0.1.2 of fsimage contains the following software:

crosstool-0.28-rc37
linux-2.6.10
binutils-2.15
gcc-3.4.2
glibc-2.3.3
busybox-1.00
tar-1.14
e2fsprogs-1.35
reiserfsprogs-3.6.19

fsimage has been developed under Gentoo Linux on a PowerPC platform.
The binary should in theory work on almost any operating system, as long as the
platform is supported by qemu and a bourne-compatible shell is available.

Installation: ./configure && make && make install
Usage: Try fsimage --help to get started.

Enjoy!
